# Internationalization (i18n)

The dashboard supports multiple languages to provide a localized experience for both international teams and clients.

## 🌍 Language Management

The frontend uses a custom **LanguageContext** to manage translations without the overhead of heavy external libraries.

### Core Components
- `LanguageContext.tsx`: The provider that wraps the application and stores the current language state.
- `translations.ts`: A centralized TypeScript object containing all localized strings.

## 🛠️ How to add a new language

1.  Open `frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts`.
2.  Define a new key in the `translations` object (e.g., `de` for German).
3.  Copy and translate all keys from the base language (`en`).
4.  Update the language switcher component to include the new option.

## 💾 Persistence

The user's language choice is automatically persisted in **localStorage**.
- On initial load, the app checks for a stored preference.
- If no preference is found, it defaults to the browser's language or English.

## Usage in Components

```tsx
const { t } = useLanguage();

return (
    <button>{t('login.submit')}</button>
);
```
This pattern ensures that every part of the UI can be updated instantly when the language is changed.
